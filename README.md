## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations - Project 5 - Deep Reinforcement learning - Teach a Quadcopter how to fly.
# Ricardo Picatoste

This is the first attempt to do the Deep Reinforcement learning project.

It is based on the code provided in the introductory points of the project.

The result (explained further in the jupyter notebook) is that I did not manage to make the quadcopter learn.

There is a second attempt based on a different code adaptation, with similar results:
